**BixbyShopApp** 

**Project Description**: I belong to NIBM 2023 DSE Batch. We have completed one part of our diploma, which is Graphical-User-Interface. Our teacher Mr. Keshan asked us to prepare a project based on what we have learned so far. My team created a shopping app called Bixby Shop App. Users can log in and register, order and sell products. It is very simple. We programmed this app in the context of what Mr. Keshan taught us, but we also added some extra features that weren't too complicated.

This application does not reflect my complete knowledge of computer science and programming. (If you're on our team, please feel free to edit this.) Why am I saying this? If you are on the admissions committee at MIT, Yale, Harvard, or Stanford, please don't judge me based on this project. I know it's very basic and they will think this is the best I can do. But that is wrong. I included a GitHub account link in my entry letter to showcase more of my work and skills, and this project is part of my account. They might think this is my talent in computer science and programming. Because I have more talent than that. I don't have a strong academic career in my life but thanks to my self-study I have very strong computer science knowledge and programming knowledge. Admissions have not started yet. I want to avoid that by adding this disclaimer as these universities are competitive and there is a 99% chance, they will reject me. Please don't take it personally.
